Abstract

   This document describes a variant of EdDSA as specified in [RFC8032]
   for blinding private and public keys such that the blinded public key
   and all signatures produced using the blinded key pair are unlinkable
   to the unblinded key pair.  Signatures produced using blinded key
   pairs are indistinguishable from standard EdDSA signatures.

1.  Introduction

   EdDSA [EDDSA] is a type of Schnorr signature algorithm based on
   Edwards curves.  The specification [RFC8032] describes several
   variants of EdDSA with parameter sets for the edwards25519 and
   edwards448 curves as described in [RFC7748].  According to the
   specification, private keys are randomly generated seeds, which are
   then used to derive scalar elements and their corresponding public
   group element for signing and verifying messages, respectively.

   Given an EdDSA private and public key pair (sk, pk), any message
   signed by sk is linkable to pk.  One simply checks whether the
   message signature is valid under pk.  In some settings, in is useful
   to produce signatures with a given key pair (sk, pk) such that the
   resulting signature is not linkable to pk without knowledge of a
   particular witness r.  That is, given pk corresponding to sk, witness
   r, and a message signature, one can determine if the signature was
   indeed produced using sk.  In effect, the witness "blinds" the key
   pair associated with a message signature.

   This document describes a modification to the EdDSA key generation
   and signing procedures in [RFC8032] to support this blinding
   operation, referred to as key blinding.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are used throughout this document to describe the
   blinding modification.

   *  sk: An EdDSA private key, which is a randomly generated private
      seed of length 32 bytes or 57 bytes according to [RFC8032],
      Section 5.1.5 or [RFC8032], Section 5.2.5, respectively.

   *  pk(sk): The public key corresponding to the private key sk.

   *  XOR(a,b): XOR of byte strings; XOR(0xF0F0, 0x1234) = 0xE2C4.  It
      is an error to call this function with two arguments of unequal
      length.

   *  ScalarMult(pk, k): Multiply the EdDSA public key pk by scalar k,
      producing a new public key as a result.

   In pseudocode descriptions below, integer multiplication of two EdDSA
   scalar values is denoted by the * operator.  For example, the product
   of two scalars x and y is denoted as x * y.

3.  Key Blinding

   At a high level, key blinding allows signers to use private keys to
   blind their signing key such that any signature produced under the
   blinded key pair is unlinkable to the original signing key pair.
   Similar to the EdDSA private key used for signing, the blind is also
   an EdDSA private key.  That is, the blind is a 32-byte or 57-byte
   random seed for Ed25519 or Ed448 variants, respectively.

   Key blinding extends the base EdDSA specification with three
   routines:

   *  BlindPublicKey(pkS, skB): Blind the public key pkS using the
      private key skB.

   *  UnblindPublicKey(pkM, skB): Unblind the public key pkM using the
      private key skB.

   *  BlindSign(skS, skB, msg): Sign a message msg using the private key
      skS with the private blind skB.

   Correctness requires the following equivalence to hold:

   UnblindPublicKey(BlindPublicKey(pkS, skB), skB) = pkS

   Security requires that signatures produced using BlindSign are
   unlinkable from signatures produced using the standard EdDSA Sign
   function with the same private key.

4.  Ed25519ph, Ed25519ctx, and Ed25519

   This section describes implementations of BlindPublicKey,
   UnblindPublicKey, and BlindSign as modifications of routines in
   [RFC8032], Section 5.1.

4.1.  BlindPublicKey and UnblindPublicKey

   BlindPublicKey transform a private blind skB into a scalar for the
   edwards25519 group and then multiplies the target key by this scalar.
   UnblindPublicKey performs essentially the same steps except that it
   multiplies the target public key by the multiplicative inverse of the
   scalar, where the inverse is computed using the order of the group L,
   described in [RFC8032], Section 5.1.

   More specifically, BlindPublicKey(pk, skB) works as follows.

   1.  Hash the 32-byte private key skB using SHA-512, storing the
       digest in a 64-octet large buffer, denoted h.  Only the lower 32
       bytes are used for generating the public key.

   2.  Prune the buffer: The lowest three bits of the first octet are
       cleared, the highest bit of the last octet is cleared, and the
       second highest bit of the last octet is set.

   3.  Interpret the buffer as the little-endian integer, forming a
       secret scalar s.  Perform a scalar multiplication ScalarMult(pk,
       s), and output the encoding of the resulting point as the public
       key.

   UnblindPublicKey(pkM, skB) works as follows.

   1.  Compute the secret scalar s from skB as in BlindPublicKey.

   2.  Compute the multiplicative inverse of s, denoted sInv, modulo L
       as defined in [RFC8032], Section 5.1.

   3.  Perform a scalar multiplication ScalarMult(pk, sInv), and output
       the encoding of the resulting point as the public key.

4.2.  BlindSign

   BlindSign transforms a private key skB into a scalar for the
   edwards25519 group and a message prefix to blind both the signing
   scalar and the prefix of the message used in the signature generation
   routine.

   More specifically, BlindSign(skS, skB, msg) works as follows:

   1.  Hash the private key skS, 32 octets, using SHA-512.  Let h denote
       the resulting digest.  Construct the secret scalar s1 from the
       first half of the digest, and the corresponding public key A1, as
       described in [RFC8032], Section 5.1.5.  Let prefix1 denote the
       second half of the hash digest, h[32],...,h[63].

   2.  Perform the same routine to transform the secret blind skB into a
       secret scalar s2, public key A2, and prefix2.

   3.  Compute the signing scalar s = s1 * s2 (mod L) and the signing
       public key A = ScalarMult(A1, s2).

   4.  Compute the signing prefix as XOR(prefix1, prefix2).

   5.  Run the rest of the Sign procedure in [RFC8032], Section 5.1.6
       from step (2) onwards using the modified scalar s, public key A,
       and string prefix.

5.  Ed448ph and Ed448

   This section describes implementations of BlindPublciKey,
   UnblindPublicKey, and BlindSign as modifications of routines in
   [RFC8032], Section 5.2.

5.1.  BlindPublicKey and UnblindPublicKey

   BlindPublicKey and UnblindPublicKey for Ed448ph and Ed448 are
   implemented just as these routines are for Ed25519ph, Ed25519ctx, and
   Ed25519, except that (1) SHAKE256 is used instead of SHA-512 for
   hashing the secret blind to a 114-byte buffer, (2) the buffer is
   pruned as described in [RFC8032], Section 5.2.5, and the order of the
   edwards448 group L is as defined in [RFC8032], Section 5.2.1.

5.2.  BlindSign

   BlindSign for Ed448ph and Ed448 is implemented just as this routine
   for Ed25519ph, Ed25519ctx, and Ed25519, except in how the scalars
   (s1, s2), public keys (A1, A2), and message strings (prefix1,
   prefix2) are computed.  More specifically, BlindSign(skS, skB, msg)
   works as follows:

   1.  Hash the private key skS, 57 octets, using SHAKE256(skS, 117).
       Let h denote the resulting digest.  Construct the secret scalar
       s1 from the first half of the digest, and the corresponding
       public key A1, as described in [RFC8032], Section 5.2.5.  Let
       prefix1 denote the second half of the hash digest,
       h[57],...,h[113].

   2.  Perform the same routine to transform the secret blind skB into a
       secret scalar s2, public key A2, and prefix2.

   3.  Compute the signing scalar s = s1 * s2 (mod L) and the signing
       public key A = ScalarMult(A1, s2).

   4.  Compute the signing prefix as XOR(prefix1, prefix2).

   5.  Run the rest of the Sign procedure in [RFC8032], Section 5.2.6
       from step (2) onwards using the modified scalar s, public key A,
       and string prefix.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a variant of the identity key blinding
   routine used in Tor's Hidden Service feature.  Security analysis for
   that feature is contained [TORBLINDING].  Further analysis is needed
   to ensure this is compliant with the signature algorithm described in
   [RFC8032].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

8.  Test Vectors

   This section contains test vectors for Ed25519 as described in
   [RFC8032].  Each test vector lists the private key and blind seeds,
   denoted skS and skB and encoded as hexadecimal strings, the unblinded
   and blinded public keys, denoted pkS and pkB and encoded according to
   [RFC8032], Section 5.1.2, and the message and signature values, each
   encoded as hexadecimal strings.
